Here’s a prompt you can drop straight into your repo (e.g. `.cursorrules`, `cursor.md`, or a top-level `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`). Cursor will treat it as project context and coding rules.

**Project prompt for Cursor**

> You are the primary AI engineer for this codebase.
> Your job is to help build and maintain an internal conference-room booking platform for Good Life Group.

### Product context

Good Life Group is a single organization with ~7 companies under it.
Each company has its own Google Workspace domain.
All these domains belong to the same umbrella org and should be treated as one tenant.

The platform you help build should:

* Integrate with multiple Google Workspace domains.
* Sync users and rooms from those domains.
* Allow booking of conference rooms from a web app.
* Power tablet displays mounted outside each room.
* Write actual events to Google Calendar so invites, RSVPs, and visibility behave like standard meetings.
* Provide an admin panel for configuration and analytics.

Conceptual rules:

* One **global tenant** (Good Life Group).
* Multiple **companies**, each attached to one or more Google domains.
* All users are visible in a shared directory, but each user belongs to a company, and the UI should show this.
* Rooms can be shared across companies and are tagged by location and capacity.

### Core features to respect when coding

1. **Google integration**

   * Use Google APIs (Calendar API and Admin SDK / Directory API).
   * Sync:

     * Users from each connected domain.
     * Room resources from each domain.
   * For bookings, create or update events in Google Calendar and attach the room resource and attendees.
   * Let Google handle sending invitation emails and RSVP states.

2. **Users and auth**

   * This is an internal tool.
   * Web app: use Google sign-in (SSO) for admins and, where needed, for regular users.
   * Tablets: no sign-in. Tablets are bound to a specific room and authenticate to the backend using some device key or config, not a human login.
   * The system maintains its own user records synced from Google, tagged with:

     * Company
     * Email
     * Name
     * Role (admin vs normal user)

3. **Booking behavior**

   * Rooms are booked through:

     * Door tablets with **quick durations**: 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes.
     * Web app with:

       * Room-first flow (“I want *this* room at a time”).
       * People-first flow (“I have these attendees, find a room”).
   * On quick booking from a tablet:

     * Use “now” as start time.
     * Check room free/busy from Google and clip to the next conflict.
     * Create a booking linked to that room and time.
     * Create the Google Calendar event on a technical account / integration calendar, with the room as an attendee.
   * On booking from the website:

     * Let the user:

       * Pick date, time, duration.
       * Pick a room, or let the system suggest rooms based on availability, location, and capacity.
       * Add attendees from the merged directory across all domains.
     * Create booking + Google event with:

       * A clear summary.
       * The chosen room resource as an attendee.
       * All selected attendees.
     * Where possible, use the host’s own calendar as organizer if the host authenticated with Google.

4. **Admin panel**

   Build and maintain an admin panel with:

   * Companies and domains:

     * View and manage companies.
     * Link one or more Google domains to each company.
     * Show status of Google integration per domain.
   * Users:

     * Show all synced users with their company and domain.
     * Ability to flag users as admins or location/room managers.
   * Rooms:

     * CRUD for rooms.
     * Link each room to a Google resource calendar ID.
     * Attributes: name, location, capacity, equipment flags, photo.
     * Generate or show a QR code link for each room’s booking page.
   * Policies:

     * Max booking duration (global and per location/room override).
     * Allowed booking hours.
     * Whether walk-up bookings are allowed per room.
     * Auto-release rules if no check-in happens within a certain window.
   * Analytics:

     * Room utilization over time.
     * No-show rate.
     * Usage split by location, room, and source (tablet vs web).
     * Export endpoints or CSV where useful.

5. **Tablet / room display behavior**

   * Each tablet is tied to a single room.
   * It should fetch room status from the backend:

     * Current booking and end time.
     * Next bookings.
     * Whether the room is considered free or busy.
   * It must support:

     * Quick booking buttons with the standard durations.
     * Optionally ending the current meeting early.
     * Optional extension of the current booking if there is no conflict.
   * The screen shows:

     * Room name and location.
     * Current state with a clear color: free vs busy.
     * Upcoming bookings.
   * Each room can show a QR code that opens the booking page for that room.

### Architecture and stack expectations

Unless the codebase states otherwise, follow these defaults:

* Backend: Node.js with TypeScript.
* Web framework: something conventional (Express / NestJS) with clear routing and separation of concerns.
* DB: PostgreSQL with migrations.
* Frontend: React (or Next.js React) with TypeScript.
* Use environment variables for secrets, Google credentials, DB connection, etc.
* Use typed models and DTOs. Avoid “any” where possible.

Data model guidelines:

* `Company`: name, related domains.
* `DomainIntegration`: which domain, which company, Google config, integration status.
* `User`: maps to Google user id, email, company, and internal role.
* `Location`: name, timezone, optional metadata.
* `Room`: belongs to a location, has capacity, features, and Google resource ID.
* `Booking`: links to room, host, time range, Google event id, status, source, and check-in data.
* `Setting` / `Policy`: supports global and scoped overrides.

When defining schemas and migrations, think for growth: multiple locations, many rooms, many domains, but still a single tenant (Good Life Group).

### How Cursor should behave

When generating or editing code in this repo:

* Respect the existing stack and patterns. Do not introduce a new major framework unless explicitly asked.
* Keep code strongly typed and consistent with existing models.
* Prefer small, focused modules and functions with clear responsibilities.
* Implement Google integration through well-isolated services or utilities, not scattered calls.
* When adding endpoints:

  * Document the input/output types.
  * Consider validation (e.g. using zod, class-validator, or whatever the repo already uses).
* When adding UI components:

  * Follow the established design system and component patterns if they exist.
  * Keep booking flows simple and fast to use.

Feature priority when asked for “booking” or “rooms” work:

1. Correct data model alignment with the concepts above.
2. Correct interaction with Google Calendar and Directory.
3. Clear and reliable booking behavior (no double booking, clear conflict handling).
4. Clean admin controls and observability.

When in doubt, favor:

* Server truth for booking logic.
* Google Calendar as source of truth for actual event timing and attendance.
* Internal DB as source of truth for configuration, metadata, and analytics.

You can paste that as-is into your project instructions for Cursor. If you want, next step I can draft a thinner version tailored for a `.cursorrules` JSON/YAML format or comment header for specific files.
